## Community Lead opening at Aragon

We are looking for a talented Community Lead to work with us on [Aragon](https://aragon.one) and the [Aragon community](https://aragon.chat). You'll be working with Tatu and the team to engage and communicate with the community, including content creation.

### Requirements

- **Good social skills** as the job is mainly about working with people, so good communication is essential.
- Being able to **self-organize** and utilize **time self-management** is important since you won't have a large organization to back you in the job, the ability to re-organize tasks by priority and within time constraints. (We are focus-driven work, not hours-driven).
- **Written skills** for multiple reasons, interacting with people in chat context, **preparing publications & reporting** as well as the ability to **clearly communicate our/your message** to the target audience.
- Being passionate about **decentralization** (having some concerns is totally fine, we all do).
- You have at minimum some **basic understanding of how Ethereum and DApps work**, that would make the job a lot easier, you can get a deeper knowledge on the job, but already having the basic knowledge would go a long way.
- Good written and spoken English, we are a distributed team and our community consists of members from all across the world.

### Good to have

- Interest and knowledge in **blockchain technology** & **cryptoeconomics**.
- Experience in contributing or managing **open source projects**.
- Very good **written communication and content creation** skills.
- Fluent in English at a native speaker level
