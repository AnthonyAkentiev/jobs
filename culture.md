## Culture at Aragon

### How we work

- We are a **fully distributed** company â€“ we don't think talent is geographically centralized. We do offsites regularly for the team to meet and work together for a week.
- We empower **deep work** sessions, minimizing bureaucracy and leaving Monday for all meetings and internal calls.
- We encourage team members to spend a substantial part of their paid work time on unrelated blockchain open source projects to speed up the development of the ecosystem.
- We are **open source only**.
- We are a technology company. Our focus is **product first**.
